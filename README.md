# MeltingPot
While attending Valencia College and University of Central Florida in Orlando Florida I have studies various programming lauguages. Melting Pot has a few of the applications I developed durring my time at both institutions. This area lists original work developed around the guidlines set forth by the professors associated with each class. Thank you for viewing.
